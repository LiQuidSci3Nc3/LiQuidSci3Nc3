- 👋 Hi, I’m @LiQuidSci3Nc3
Some old dude from down under :D

- 👀 I’m interested in ... 
Privacy, Crptograpghy, Programming, Application+Web Development (I'm still LEARNING guys n gals!), Also Networking and prefer bare metal installations but open to virtualization. It's definitely the way tech is heading so I'd better not lag behind!

- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... 
C, C#, Python, Xamirin, Kotlin, Networking & just "dipping my toes" in Cryptograpghy (Wow the complexity and math of ppl in this field amazes me!)

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... 
Absolutely anything I'm open to suggestions! Happy to do low level "donkey" work for anyone anywhere! Drop me a line if you'd like help on ANYTHING! Seriously. If you have a boring tedious task that's n00b friendly and you just can't be a$$ed, hey ask away! I'm happy to help anyone peeps :)

- 📫 How to reach me ... 
Ummm, need some help with this one! (how embarrassing!) I want to setup a FOSS Signal acc or maybe use "Briar" as my common contact info for everyone on Github to contact me.. Ahh, any suggestions where I'm not using email but also not relying on a strangers XMPP server with all my details? Would love some suggestions/help in this regard people! If you've read this far, well a big GOLD STAR AND 1 MONERO FOR YOU! Lol :D

    (p.S. I created this on my phone, oops! Will update n maybe scale back when back in front of desktop, lol)
